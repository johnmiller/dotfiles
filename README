Files in repo are hard links to originals. Tried sym links initially, but those aren't followed by git. 

Creating hard links...
ln ~/.bashrc ~/Development/dotfiles/.bashrc
ln ~/.bash_profile ~/Development/dotfiles/.bash_profile
ln ~/.gitconfig ~/Development/dotfiles/.gitconfig

I believe the mklink command can be used to create hard links in windows.
